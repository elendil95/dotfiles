In this repo you will find my dotfles for various programs, but mainly Qtile vim, zsh and Ranger.

*The install script tends to be buggy, so i suggest you deploy manually instead. The installer source code will provide all the information you need*

Running the installer will deplay my configs with the programs i like, so i suggest you take a look at the contents before running it. Also`install.sh` script only works on Arch. I am working on porting this to other distros and make this more flexible. Given a bank Arch install, the installer shuld get you to a functional desktop with all the programs you might need for day-to-day use.
