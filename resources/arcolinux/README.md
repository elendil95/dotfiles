All these scripts were shamelessly stolen from the wonderful ArcoLinux project, be sure to grab the latestt verion of everything at: https://github.com/arcolinuxd/arco-xfce

The scripts are divided in two folders, "Suggested", and "Optional"

The scripts in the Suggested folders will install core components, namely:

- XFCE4 desktop and LightDM display manager
- Sound control with Alsa
- Bluetooth support
- Printers
- Extra fonts needed by software later on

The scripts in the Optional folders will install Samba and Network discovery, as well as a bunch of software that came with the Arcolinux desktop: most of these are normal stuff like libreoffie and firefox, but feel fre to take a look and skip them if you wanna do it yourself :)
